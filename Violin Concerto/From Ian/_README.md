# Liria-Music
**Piano Duet Project**

We need to engrave:
1. 7 Movements of Violin-Piano Score
2. Engrave the Orchestral versions of these movements.
3. Make Parts

We will work movement by movement. This sheet will be updated as more information about the project surfaces.

We will need Sibelius Ultimate. If you don't have you can use the computer in the school library. If you have Sibelius Ultimate, please ensure you have updated to the latest version - 2020.1

Please follow the font guidelines. I have already set it up as this, so just make sure you have the fonts.

- Main Text Font - Goudy Old Style
- Main Music Font - Petrucci
- Page Size - 10x13
- Staff Size - 4.5mm 
Font Sizes
- Expression = 11
- Technique = 11
- Tempo = 12 (Font Arial Bold)

Please ensure that the measure layout follows the PDF exactly, to make proofreading easier. We can rearrange afterwards. 

## Procedure:

This will be easy to manage as we will do the work incrementally. Once one person is done with their work, they will let the team know, and the next person will start the process - like a relay race lol.

Movement I - Ian
Movement II - Avik
Movement III - 
Movement IV - 
Movement V - 
Movement VI - 
Movement VII - 

***File Naming Conventions***

Schachter_YYYYMMDD_yourname_versionnumber

E.g. Avik engraved some of the music on Sunday, the 1st of March, 2020. 
Filename = Schachter_20200301_avik_01

Now, Avik engraved more music on Friday, the 6th of March, 2020. He keeps Schachter_20200301_avik_01 in his folder, and SAVES AS to create a new file. 
Filename = Schachter_20200306_avik_02

***Updateing Google Sheets*

Avik is the project manager for this project. He will update the google sheets as people complete their tasks. Additionally, he will ensure the team is on track and also naming files etc. accordingly.

***Proofreading***

Once your portion is engraved, you will export a PDF and add it to the Proof Reading folder. Name it
Schachter_Proof_yourname

Your proofreader will proofread the PDF, annotate it with edits to be made, and upload it to the Proof Reading folder as
Schachter_Proof_theirname_checked

E.g. Avik is done with his work (finally) and uploads to the Proof Reading folder as:

Schachter_Proof_avik

Chris proofreads his work, annotates the PDF and uploads to the Proof Reading folder as:
Schachter_Proof_avik_checked

reinier will make all the edits once all the proofs have come in, so make sure not to make too many mistakes, or incur his wrath. You will wait until all the music has been engraved, and then go ahead and make the edits. Once this has been done, you will save the filename as
Pianoduet_YYYYMMDD_Final_version 
(In case you don't proofread in one sitting, or further issues are noticed after your initial edit)

I will then deliver to the client. 

**Payment**
Below is the pay for each engraver. This is based on the number of measures, and other responsibilities (such as management). If you would like a mangement position for a future role (and thus a higher pay, just ask, and be able to deliver).

Payment TBD (expected >$250 per person, or even more)
