**Piano Duet Project**

We need to engrave 65 pages of piano duet music.
We will divide the work into 5 parts. Approximately 13 pages per person. Exact assignments will be given out by 1st March 2020. 

We will need Sibelius Ultimate. If you don't have you can use the computer in the school library. If you have Sibelius Ultimate, please ensure you have updated to the latest version - 2020.1

Please follow the font guidelines:

- Main Text Font - Bodoni
- Main Music Font - Opus
- Page Size - A4
- Staff Size - 7.0mm
Font Sizes
- Expression = 11
- Technique = 11
- Tempo = 12

Please ensure that the measure layout follows the PDF exactly, to make proofreading easier. 

## Procedure:

This will be easy to manage as we will do the work incrementally. Once one person is done with their work, they will let the team know, and the next person will start the process - like a relay race lol.

mm. 1-126 (until Scherzando e misterioso)
mm. 127-249 (until metric modulation)
mm. 250-385 (until Mambo)
mm. 386-530 (until Cha-Cha)
mm. 530-713 (until Rumble)
mm. 714 - End 

***File Naming Conventions***

Pianoduet_YYYYMMDD_yourname_versionnumber

E.g. Avik engraved some of the music on Sunday, the 1st of March, 2020. 
Filename = Pianoduet_20200301_avik_01

Now, Avik engraved more music on Friday, the 6th of March, 2020. He keeps Pianoduet_20200301_avik_01 in his folder, and SAVES AS to create a new file. 
Filename = Pianoduet_20200306_avik_02

***Updateing Google Sheets*

reinier is the project manager for this project. He will update the google sheets as people complete their tasks. Additionally, he will ensure the team is on track and also naming files etc. accordingly.

***Proofreading***

Once your portion is engraved, you will export a PDF and add it to the Proof Reading folder. Name it
Pianoduet_Proof_yourname

Your proofreader will proofread the PDF, annotate it with edits to be made, and upload it to the Proof Reading folder as
Pianoduet_Proof_theirname_checked

E.g. Avik is done with his work (finally) and uploads to the Proof Reading folder as:

Pianoduet_Proof_avik

Chris proofreads his work, annotates the PDF and uploads to the Proof Reading folder as:
Pianoduet_Proof_avik_checked

reinier will make all the edits once all the proofs have come in, so make sure not to make too many mistakes, or incur his wrath. You will wait until all the music has been engraved, and then go ahead and make the edits. Once this has been done, you will save the filename as
Pianoduet_YYYYMMDD_Final_version 
(In case you don't proofread in one sitting, or further issues are noticed after your initial edit)

I will then deliver to the client. 

**Payment**
Below is the pay for each engraver. This is based on the number of measures, and other responsibilities (such as management). If you would like a mangement position for a future role (and thus a higher pay, just ask, and be able to deliver).

Reinier = $250
Jay = $100
Ian = $120

For this particular job, because the client is an international client - it is a difficult to do a milestone payment (costs money to transfer to bank account)

Thus, I will pay you all $50 after your initial engraving work from my own pocket, and then pay you the remainder within 2 weeks of receiving payment from the client.
