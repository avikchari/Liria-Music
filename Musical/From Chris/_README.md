# Liria-Music
**Musical**

The project is still in the air. As I figure out the scale of the project and work out a price, I will then give you an idea of the overall payment. 

Notation Software: Sibelius Ultimate, ideally, or Sibelius 7.5.

Please follow the font guidelines:

- Main Text Font - Bodoni (font will be provided if you don't have)
- Main Music Font - Opus
- Page Size - Letter
- Staff Size - 7.0mm
Font Sizes
- Expression = 11
- Technique = 11
- Tempo = 12 

Notation isn't a huge deal for this project. For the transcription, focus more on getting the notes, tempo, meter, key right, as the mockup orchestration is the most important. 

## Procedure:

The client will usually send us audio files (Piano + Voice).
The music will be transcribed, and then orchestrated. 

Since this isn't a complex project, file naming is simple. We won't be going complex with versions.

1. Use the audio file provided in the client folder (_From Client)
2. Create a sibelius file in your folder (From Blake). Name it Audrey Pillsbury-Piece Title.sib
3. Once you have completed transcribing and are ready to send it to me, copy paste the file into my folder (From Avik)
4. Then, rename your file with the date appended at the start, e.g. 2020 05 20 Audrey Pillsbury-Piece Title.sib. This is in case we end up having more versions, or some file gets deleted, we have still have your original sibelius file good to go.
5. I will use the sibelius file you created to make a mockup for the client. 

***Updateing Google Sheets*

Avik is the project manager for this project. He will update the google sheets as people complete their tasks. Additionally, he will ensure the team is on track and also naming files etc. accordingly.
