**Opera Parts Project**

We need to create parts for the opera.
Parts are divided as on the google sheets.
Ian - Winds
Avik - Brass + Percussion
Jay - Piano + Strings

We will need Sibelius Ultimate. If you don't have you can use the computer in the school library. If you have Sibelius Ultimate, please ensure you have updated to the latest version - 2020.1

Leave the fonts and sizes as is.

Please look out for page turns. 

## Procedure:

Each person will copy the files into their folder, rename them, and create parts. (No need to extact!)

Rename them as Opera_yourname_movementno

Eg. Opera_avik_4

Once all the parts for an instrument have been created. Collate them into a single PDF using preview. Whenver possible, try to make it so that each movement can be played without a page turn, or limited turns.

***File Naming Conventions***

Since there are so many movements, no need to create versions. 

For the PDFs,

Opera_instrumentno-instrument_movementno

Eg. Flute part from movement 6a would have the following filename:

Opera_1-Flute_6a

Eg. Piano part from movement 18:

Opera_7-Piano_18

Please export these files to the proofreading folder.

***Updateing Google Sheets*

Ian is the project manager for this project. He will update the google sheets as people complete their tasks. Additionally, he will ensure the team is on track and also naming files etc. accordingly. 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19uLdBYp4Xv3WaFh_ZF0vFTq0HFNYR4J6a31QDOrjqTE/edit?usp=sharing

***Proofreading***

As mentioned above, export PDF to proofreading folder.

Your proofreader will proofread the PDF, annotate it with edits to be made, and upload it to the Proof Reading folder as
Opera_instrumentno-instrument_movementno_checked (i.e. just append with "checked").


Ian will make all the edits once all the proofs have come in, so make sure not to make too many mistakes, or incur his wrath. You will wait until all the music has been engraved, and then go ahead and make the edits. Once this has been done, you will save the filename as
Opera_instrumentno-instrument_movementno_Final

I will then deliver to the client. 

***Cuts and additional music***
Additionally, the client will send us further PDFs of parts that we will have to combine into what we have. These will be of different movements, so look out for page turns. More about this later.

There will also be the following cuts. We will mark this to the PDF aftwards, and not on the sibelius file. Don't worry about this until after the parts have been created.

#4 
- 1st Verse only (remove 1st ending)

#6 
- cut mm.11-23

#7  
- cut mm.16-21
- cut m.24 beat 2 (the 4th 8th note) to m.28 beat 1 (the 3rd 8th note)
- cut m.35-53
- cut 1st ending (m.98) and repeat signs
- cut m.124 through m. 322
- cut m.327-330
- cut m. 357-360

#10 
- cut m.33 to end. We are doing an attacca to the next movement, so if this could possibly be worked into the page turns in the parts, that would be wonderful.

#11 
- remove 1st ending and repeat

#12 - cut 9-16
- cut 41-48
- cut 57-64
- cut 73-88
- cut 112-119

#16 
- cut mm.158-190, 249-352

#18 
- cut m.20-27
- cut m.38-70

#19 
- remove repeat signs


**Payment**
Below is the pay for each engraver. This is based on the number of measures, and other responsibilities (such as management). If you would like a mangement position for a future role (and thus a higher pay, just ask, and be able to deliver).

Ian = $200
Jay = $150
